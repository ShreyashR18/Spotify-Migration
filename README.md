This program allows you to seamlessly transfer your playlists from Spotify to YouTube Music.

## **How It Works**

Follow these steps to migrate your playlist:

2. **Confirm Account Selection**  
   - Once you have selected your Google account, press **Enter** to proceed.

3. **Authorize Spotify Access**  
   - A second browser window will open, requesting permission to access your Spotify account. Grant the required permissions to continue.

4. **View Your Spotify Playlists**  
   - After authentication, all available Spotify playlists will be displayed.

5. **Select a Playlist**  
   - Choose the playlist you wish to export to YouTube Music.

6. **Monitor the Transfer Process**  
   - A progress bar will indicate the status of the playlist migration.

7. **Completion & Review**  
   - Once the transfer is complete, a summary will be displayed. If any songs could not be added, they will be listed. Otherwise, your playlist has been successfully migrated to YouTube Music.

Enjoy your music on YouTube Music!
